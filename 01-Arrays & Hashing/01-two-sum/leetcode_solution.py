# Approach 1: Brute Force
# The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xxx and find if there is another value that equals to target−xtarget - xtarget−x.


class Solution1:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[j] == target - nums[i]:
                    return [i, j]


# Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table
# A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (target−nums[i]target - nums[i]target−nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i]nums[i]nums[i] itself!


class Solution2:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in hashmap and hashmap[complement] != i:
                return [i, hashmap[complement]]
        return []


# Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table
# It turns out we can do it in one-pass. While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the hash table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.


class Solution3:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in hashmap:
                return [i, hashmap[complement]]
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i

        return []
